      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Let’s say one day you decided “hey, I want to learn web programming.” So you decided to go to google, and you search “web programming tutorials.” Then you see a plethora of links and videos and you don’t know which one is best and you don’t know which one to choose. So you feel overwhelmed. You might even give it all up. As someone who is also studying web programming, I know the pain all too well. Fortunately, I am taking a class called Web Fundamentals, which has provided me with many useful links, resources, and lessons. I will not be copying the lesson plans from my class. Instead, I will be creating a website that will guide you step by step the way I learned web development. I am building this website in order to help guide you, a fellow student/enthusiast to gradually get into the wonderful world of web development.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Are you one of the following: Someone new to programming, an enthusiast trying to get into web design and development, a veteran web developer trying to relearn what you've forgotten, an enthusiast here to rip apart and analyze all the mistakes newbies make? If so, then you've come to the right place. Welcome to my newbie's guide to web development!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/11151c-f5f9e9-d5a021-2d82b7" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/11151c-f5f9e9-d5a021-2d82b7</a>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary colored">#11151C</td><td class="secondary">#F5F9E9</td><td class="accent1">#D5A021</td><td class="accent2">#2D82B7</td></tr>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: DotGothic16  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose DotGothic16 for my heading font because I feel nostalgic for the old 16 bit games (you know, the ones you play in gameboys and old pixel games). It also adds a retro feel that I feel matches the "tech" vibe that I want to portray.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Indie Flower  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I am going to be teaching web programming through this website as I am learning it myself. So I felt like the most appropriate way to do so is to make journal style lesson plans. In order to do that, I have to find a font that looks almost like handwriting and since cursive-type fonts are harder to read, I chose this one instead.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home | HTML & other basic stuff you'd need to know</h3>
      <p>
              My site might be one amongst many of the plethora of websites out there teaching people how to do web development, many of which will have videos that I will have no chance of competing against. Then why even go to my site? For one, it is written by a beginner, for beginner. I know just how difficult it is to get started with web programming, so I am going to try to teach the way I started to figure things out. My site will answer any questions that newbies might have in the back of their mind that they can not easily Google, because they do not even know the necessary terminologies and such to find it in the first place.
        The type of information necessary to complete any actions my site offers will be mostly reading and self-teaching. As I mentioned above, I cannot provide or make videos comparable to Khan Academy or other such better funded companies. I can, however, give insights to the small or minor details missed by experts that plagues newcomers. Unfortunately, because I am such a beginner myself, all I can provide is written directions and statements. So, all you visitors better beware, read carefully! If it makes you feel any better, I will try to restate everything as simple as I could make it.
        If I can get around to it, and have learned more about html and css, I will try to create a forum or a chat, where one newbie can help another. After all, one of the best ways to learn is to teach! I do not yet know how complex that task will be however, so I am not sure if it is something feasible for now. Other things I could do would be to create a journal section so they can keep track of their progress. I could also create a list of useful links that might be better at explaining the more complex terms and procedures.

        The first thing you'd need is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write the code in, and a place to host your website. Fortunately, <a target="_blank" href="https://glitch.com">glitch.com</a> provides both, I highly recommend it!

      <p>
        HTML is just the basic foundation of your website, something to get it up and running. In order to make it look nice, you'd need to use CSS to style things up!

      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        Now that our website looks nice and pretty, let's add more functionality! We do that by adding scripts. There are multiple choices out there, but let's use JavaScript for now.
