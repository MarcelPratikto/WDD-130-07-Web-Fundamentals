                My site might be one amongst many of the plethora of websites out there teaching people how to do web development, many of which will have videos that I will have no chance of competing against. Then why even go to my site? For one, it is written by a beginner, for beginner. I know just how difficult it is to get started with web programming, so I am going to try to teach the way I started to figure things out. My site will answer any questions that newbies might have in the back of their mind that they can not easily Google, because they do not even know the necessary terminologies and such to find it in the first place.
          The type of information necessary to complete any actions my site offers will be mostly reading and self-teaching. As I mentioned above, I cannot provide or make videos comparable to Khan Academy or other such better funded companies. I can, however, give insights to the small or minor details missed by experts that plagues newcomers. Unfortunately, because I am such a beginner myself, all I can provide is written directions and statements. So, all you visitors better beware, read carefully! If it makes you feel any better, I will try to restate everything as simple as I could make it.
          If I can get around to it, and have learned more about html and css, I will try to create a forum or a chat, where one newbie can help another. After all, one of the best ways to learn is to teach! I do not yet know how complex that task will be however, so I am not sure if it is something feasible for now. Other things I could do would be to create a journal section so they can keep track of their progress. I could also create a list of useful links that might be better at explaining the more complex terms and procedures.

          The first thing you'd need is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write the code in, and a place to host your website. Fortunately, <a target="_blank" href="https://glitch.com">glitch.com</a> provides both, I highly recommend it!
